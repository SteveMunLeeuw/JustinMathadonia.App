        <strong>Beer-Run</strong></p>
    <p>
        Whether traveling or visiting friends figuring out where you can have a social drink can be a pain. Asking an uptight elderly person where the nearest bar is will rattle the steeliest of nerves.

        A Google map with your location highlighting where you can and can&#39;t get a drink of alcohol. Whether you want a cocktail at a bar, a margarita or two with dinner, pick up a bottle of wine for a house warming or just grab a beer after that long bike ride. We are here to help.
