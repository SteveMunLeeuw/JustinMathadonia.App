        When you open the app it shows your location on a map.&nbsp; If the background shading is green, you are in a wet county meaning you can stock up on beer and wine at a grocerty store, get your cocktail supplies at a liquor store and go out to a bar.&nbsp; If you find that you&#39;re in a red area you can&#39;t do any of that.&nbsp; If the shading is somewhere in between click on the area and you&#39;ll get more information.&nbsp; Sometimes you can buy liquor, sometimes it&#39;s the other way around and one state has an exemption if you&#39;re on&nbsp; a golf course.</p>
